    "description":"First resin model I assembled, took some time to figure out how to fill gaps properly, etc, but I think it worked out well. Also the first Drukhari model I painted, very satisfying to paint the armour, and I mostly finished the model in one night. Bought by my wife because she liked the purple, so I had to try and recreate it from the box. The purple was given to me for free when a local store got the range in, so I took my chance to use it.",
