    "description":"A very difficult colour decision because I wanted him to pair well with my Sentinel, but not exactly match. Very very proud of the freehand on the cloak, and I think the colours tie it together nicely and contrast well with the base. I still went with a classic Mars-looking base because it really just works for Mechanicus and it looked fun, even if the base doesn't match the Sentinel.",
