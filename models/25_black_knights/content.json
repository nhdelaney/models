    "description":"Painting skeletons is always fun and satisfying, and these guys had some nice extra details like vines and leaves. I probably used too many subassemblies painting them, but it made painting the horse cloaks easier, even if everything else was harder. Also, I tried to paint on the scratched edges of the armour manually with a fine brush to try and up my skills, but I just couldn't get it to look good at all. I switched back to drybrushing and it worked way better, so even though it's so easy it feels like cheating, I'm probably going to keep drybrushing scratches and damage for a long time.",
